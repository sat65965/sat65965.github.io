Welcome to my page! My name is <b>Suzanne Turry</b> and I am a 4th-year student at the University of Georgia! I am a Psychology major and a Spanish minor with Pre-Physician Assistant intent. At the University of Georgia, I work as a research assistant in the UGA Infant Lab. This lab studies developmental psychology and I have linked our website below.  
<a HREF="UGAInfantLab.html">UGA Infant Lab.</a>
This lab is currently studying how short term memory develops in infants and how it correlates to other mental aspects.</p>

<h2 style="color:white;text-align:center">Volunteer Work</h2>
<p style="text-indent:30pt">
I am graduating <i>May 2019</i> and I will hopefully be attending PA School. I have done a lot of volunteer work in the past. Some of this work includes going to Lima, Peru and working in the field giving healthcare to people in need. This was an experience that I will never forget. I was able to work in dentistry, general practice, OBGYN, and pediatrics. 
I met so many amazing people, including a woman who was so appreciative of us coming to her community to help. Another amazing piece of this work was that we built a staircase for them to walk down to get an education, as well as have access to more jobs.

<h2 style="color:white;text-align:center">Traveling</h2>
<p>
In addition, I absolutely love traveling. I have been to 
<b>over 15 different countries</b> including Spain, Turkey, Greece, and Japan!
Nothing better than traveling with my family.</p>
<p style="text-indent:30pt">
Another interesting fact about me is that I am a <b>certified clinical medical assistant.</b> I was certified October 2017 and have worked as a medical assistant for the past year.
I love helping patients and making them feel comfortable when they come in for a check up. For Physician Assistant School, I am planning on working as a CCMA to obtain my direct patient care hours. 
This will give me more experience in the healthcare field before studying to become a Physician Assistant. </p>
